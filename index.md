# About Me

Hello! 
My name is Alex Vogler, and I currently work for Acumen as a data and policy analyst, where I look for potentially fraudulent behavior by Medicaid providers.
Previously, I obtained my Master's degree in Physics at UC Davis, where I conducted research on galaxy composition.
I also researched supermassive black holes at UC Irvine while earning my Bachelor's degree.

# Interests

I love cities and everything that makes them function, especially public transportation and housing. 
I am always trying to learn more about public transportation, bicycle infrastructure, and zoning and land use policies and their impacts.

- [Covid Impact on San Diego Rail Ridership](./CovidRidership.html) - I looked at the impact of Covid on rail ridership (MTS trolley lines, COASTER, and SPRINTER) using ridership data from the SANDAG open data portal covering the years 2019-2022. Some lines were hit harder than others, and recovery rates in 2021 and 2022 differ substantially.

- [Copper Line Ridership Impact Estimate](./MTS_Copper_Line_Transfer_Estimate.html) - MTS estimates that about 8% of Orange and Green Line riders will be impacted by the opening of the Copper Line. I try to replicate this number using SANDAG open data portal ridership data.
