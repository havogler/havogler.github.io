# Hello!

I love cities and everything that make them function, especially public transportation and housing. I am always trying to learn more about public transportation, bicycle infrastructure, and zoning and land use policies and their impacts.

This is my personal website, where I'll post about cool stuff I'm working on and personal updates! Here are some things I've looked into recently:

[Covid Impact on San Diego Rail Ridership](./CovidRidership.html).

[Copper Line Ridership Impact Estimate](./MTS_Copper_Line_Transfer_Estimate.html).
