# About Me

Hello! 
My name is Alex Vogler, and I currently work for Acumen as a data and policy analyst, where I look for potentially fraudulent behavior by Medicaid providers.
Previously, I obtained my Masters in Physics at UC Davis, where I conducted research on galaxy composition.
I'm also a UC Irvine alumnus.

# Interests

I love cities and everything that makes them function, especially public transportation and housing. 
I am always trying to learn more about public transportation, bicycle infrastructure, and zoning and land use policies and their impacts.
